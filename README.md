# Tejas Nanoti's Personal Portfolio Website ðŸš€

This repository contains the codebase for my personal portfolio website. I'm creating this small README to list the technologies I have used.

## HTML 5

For now, since this is my first personal portfolio, I've decide to stick with the conventional **HTML 5** to avoid hassles during deployment. HTML is the standard and pretty much the first language developer choose to start with web.

## Sass

**Sass** (Syntactically awesome Stylesheets) is a new way (pretty old now though) to write css with more human-readable syntax. It is fairly easy to install and run Sass. Sass compiler compiles Sass code to css code behind the scenes.

> We can install Sass like this:

```bash
npm install Sass
```

> To use Sass we need to continuosly watch for changes and then compile it to css code for this we can use the following script:

```bash
sass --watch ./sass/main.scss:./css/styles.css
```

## Deployment ðŸš€

My personal portfolio is currently available on this domain: [Tejas Nanoti's Personal Portfolio](https://tejasnanoti.vercel.app)

## Update ðŸš¨

I'm planning on working on a new personal portofolio soon, which I'm considering building on **React** and **Chakra-UI**. Once the work has started, I'll update this README to include the link for it.
